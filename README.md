Problem
Amazon delivery drivers encounter everyday obstacles like adverse weather, problematic pets, and unresponsive recipients, 
all slowing down their deliveries. Making deliveries through a Package Delivery Robot streamlines this process. 
Drivers can leave packages with the robot in the garden, then the robot will deliver it to the doorstep and play a short music upon arrival to let the recipient know their package 
is here, ensuring efficient and reliable delivery, regardless of external factors.

High-Level mission goals
Efficient package delivery: Allow Amazon delivery drivers to drop off packages with a remotely controlled Delivery Robot stationed in the garden. 
Avoid obstacles: Navigate around trees, rocks and possible cliffs in the garden.
Travel to the doorstep: The doorstep is indicated by four thin pillars arranged in a square fashion. When arrived, let the owner know weâ€™re here by playing a sound.
