# Package Delivery Robot: Enhancing Amazon Deliveries  

## Problem  
Amazon delivery drivers face numerous challenges during their daily routes, including adverse weather conditions, encounters with problematic pets, and unresponsive recipients. These obstacles slow down the delivery process and reduce efficiency.  

Introducing a **Package Delivery Robot** to streamline deliveries:  
- Drivers can leave packages with the robot stationed in the garden.  
- The robot autonomously delivers the package to the recipientâ€™s doorstep.  
- Upon arrival, the robot plays a short tune to notify the recipient that their package has been delivered.  

This approach ensures **efficient** and **reliable** deliveries, regardless of external factors.  

## High-Level Mission Goals  

1. **Efficient Package Delivery:**  
   - Allow Amazon delivery drivers to drop off packages with a remotely controlled Delivery Robot stationed in the garden.  

2. **Obstacle Avoidance:**  
   - Navigate around common garden obstacles such as trees, rocks, and cliffs.  

3. **Doorstep Navigation:**  
   - Identify the doorstep, indicated by four thin pillars arranged in a square.  
   - Upon reaching the doorstep, notify the recipient by playing a sound.  

## Hardware and Technology  
- **CyBot**: The Package Delivery Robot will utilize CyBot for autonomous navigation and delivery.  
- **Microcontroller**: Built on **TM4C Microcontrollers** for precision control and efficient performance.
